# Transport Module

**Transport** (domestic/inland transport) covers trucking, last-mile delivery, and multi-stop logistics. In CargoNext, the Transport module manages: Sales Quote → Transport Order → Transport Job → Transport Leg → Run Sheet → Proof of Delivery → Billing.

Industry terms: **LTL** (Less Than Truckload), **FTL** (Full Truckload), **POD** (Proof of Delivery), **Run Sheet**, **Dispatch**, **Consolidation**.

To access the Transport workspace, go to:

**Home > Transport**

## 1. Typical Workflow

1. **Quote** – Create [Sales Quote](welcome/sales-quote) with transport legs
2. **Order** – Create [Transport Order](welcome/transport-order) from quote or manually
3. **Job** – Create [Transport Job](welcome/transport-job) from order
4. **Plan** – Use [Transport Plan](welcome/transport-plan) for capacity and scheduling
5. **Run Sheet** – Create [Run Sheet](welcome/run-sheet) to group legs for drivers
6. **Execution** – Use [Run Sheet Scan](welcome/run-sheet-scan) page for mobile scanning
7. **POD** – Capture [Proof of Delivery](welcome/proof-of-delivery)
8. **Billing** – Create [Sales Invoice](welcome/sales-invoice) from job

## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1 Transport Leg

A leg is one pickup-to-delivery segment. A job can have multiple legs (multi-stop). Each leg has origin, destination, scheduled date/time, and vehicle assignment.

### 2.2 Run Sheet

A Run Sheet groups multiple legs (from one or more jobs) for a driver/vehicle. Used for route optimization and driver assignment.

### 2.3 Consolidation

[Transport Consolidation](welcome/transport-consolidation) groups multiple jobs for shared truckload or multi-stop optimization.
