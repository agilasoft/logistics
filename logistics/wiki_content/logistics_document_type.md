# Logistics Document Type

**Logistics Document Type** is a master that defines the standard document types used across CargoNext for document tracking. Examples include Commercial Invoice (CI), Packing List (PL), Bill of Lading (BL), Air Waybill (AWB), Certificate of Origin, and Proof of Delivery.

Each document type has a code, name, category (Trade, Transport, Customs, Insurance, DG, Other), typical format (PDF, Image, Excel, Any), and whether it has an expiry date.
