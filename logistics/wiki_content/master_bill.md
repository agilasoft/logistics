# Master Bill

**Master Bill** (Master Bill of Lading) is issued by the carrier to the freight forwarder for consolidated (LCL) cargo. The forwarder issues House BLs to individual shippers; the Master BL covers the consolidated container.

Industry practice: One Master BL per container; multiple House BLs reference it.
