# General Job

**General Job** is a flexible job document for multi-leg or combined logistics operations that do not fit a single product type. It can link to Air Shipments, Sea Shipments, Transport Jobs, Warehouse Jobs, and Declarations.

A General Job is used when a shipment involves multiple modes (e.g., sea + transport + customs) and you need a parent job to track the overall flow. It has a Documents tab and optional Milestones tab.
